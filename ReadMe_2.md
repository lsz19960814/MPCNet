This is the code corresponding to article A submitted to tkde. The Graph_sim folder corresponds to the Graph similarity in the article, and the Stock folder corresponds to Multipersistence GCN. Due to the upload limitation of GitHub, we provide a trained model with data from 1999 to 2020 as the training set and data from 2021 as the test set as the code validation. Just run train.py. If retraining is required, you need to first obtain stock daily data from tushare and place it in the day_csv sub folder under the Graphssim folder. Run day_sc.py in the Graphssim folder, then run Run_model. py in the Stock folder, and finally run train.py with the parameter -- need_train.
